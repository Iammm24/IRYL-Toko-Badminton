# Badminton Store Website

This project is a modified front-end web application for an online badminton store built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The original project was a basic front-end template without a license. This repository includes significant enhancements and additional features such as:

- Shopping cart functionality with product images
- Quantity management and dynamic total price calculation
- Add and remove items from cart
- Animated product cards and interactive buttons
- Visual feedback when items are added to the cart
- Functional product search with direct filtering and display

This project does not include any back-end implementation and is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.
